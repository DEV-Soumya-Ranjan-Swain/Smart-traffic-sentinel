# Smart Traffic Sentinel

Smart Traffic Sentinel is a revolutionary solution designed to address the growing concern of traffic violations and promote responsible driving behavior within communities. Leveraging the power of smartphones, computer vision, and machine learning, our platform empowers users to contribute to road safety by reporting instances of traffic rule violations.

## Problem Statement

The prevalence of traffic violations has become a significant issue, with many drivers disregarding rules unless directly monitored by authorities. This behavior not only jeopardizes road safety but also undermines the effectiveness of existing enforcement measures.

## Solution

Our solution harnesses the ubiquity of smartphones and advancements in technology to create a comprehensive approach to tackling traffic violations. Through a user-friendly web application, individuals can upload video evidence of traffic infractions, which undergo thorough analysis using computer vision and machine learning algorithms.

The workflow includes:

1. **Video Processing**: Utilizing OpenCV for efficient video analysis.
2. **Object Detection**: Employing TensorFlow's Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize specific violations such as helmet usage and motorcycle presence.
3. **License Plate Recognition**: Extracting vehicle license plate numbers to further identify offenders.
4. **Verification and Reward**: Valid complaints are verified by administrators and users are rewarded with a bounty for contributing to road safety.

## Tech Stack

- **Django**: A robust and scalable backend framework.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Creating an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.
- **OpenCV**: Facilitating video processing and analysis.
- **TensorFlow**: Developing CNN models for object detection and license plate recognition.
- **Python**: Backend development and machine learning model implementation.

## Business Model

Our sustainability lies in a novel business model that incentivizes community participation in road safety. Users submitting valid video evidence receive bounties as a token of appreciation for their contribution. Furthermore, the platform can establish partnerships with law enforcement agencies, insurance companies, and municipalities to provide valuable data insights into traffic patterns and violations.

## Impact

Smart Traffic Sentinel transcends being merely a mobile application; it represents a holistic approach to fostering a culture of responsible driving. By combining cutting-edge technology with community participation and education, we aim to create a safer road environment and promote a culture of responsibility among drivers.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers, data scientists, and enthusiasts passionate about leveraging technology for societal good. Whether it's enhancing our machine learning models, improving user experience, or expanding our partnerships, your contributions are invaluable in making our roads safer for everyone.

Join us in our mission to revolutionize road safety through technology!
